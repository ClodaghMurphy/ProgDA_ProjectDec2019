## Plan for ProgDA Project based on the marking scheme
Intial Steps: Creategithub repository, create notebook, prepare project plan.<br>
Research: Investigation of the OPW Heritage Site Details data set as demonstrated by references, background information and approach.<br>
Development: Clear, well-written, and efficient code with appropriate comments.<br>
Consistency: Good planning and pragmatic attitude to work as evidenced by commit history.<br>
Documentation: Concise descriptions and plots of variables in the data set.<br>
Conclusion: Summarise findings of the analysis.<br>

## 1. Description of the Project
• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.<br>
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.<br>
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.<br>
• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
    data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.<br>

## 3. How to run the jupyter notebook containing this project 
Jupyter Notebooks are a spin-off project from the IPython project. The name, Jupyter, comes from the programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R.<br>
It is an open source web application used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and text.<br>
The Jupyter Notebook is a useful tool to learn Python language and also enables sharing of data and images in a very accessible way.<br>
In order to install: On the command line, $ pip install jupyter<br>
After intall, on terminal, type the command: $ jupyter notebook<br>
Jupyter will initialise in the background and your default browser will pop up in a new tab connecting to webserver.<br> http://localhost:8888/tree<br>
The terminal will simultaneously display instructions on how to stop the connection to that webserver in addition to URL details that <br>contain a unique token.<br>

http://localhost:8888/?token=XXXXXYYYYY123456789<br>
Chrome and firefox are the optimal web browsers to use and you may need to copy the url into one of these instead of using the default<br> pop-up.<br>
You are running the Jupyter server and can use it to open and engage with my repository contents.<br>
